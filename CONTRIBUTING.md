## What is ZKAuth?

**ZKAuth** is an offline identity verification system for Android that proves you are who you claim to be—**without revealing any personal data**.

### The Problem It Solves
- 🔐 Passwords are outdated and insecure
- 📱 Phone biometrics leak metadata to apps
- 🌍 KYC/identity systems collect excessive personal data
- ⚡ Cross-device login requires internet (not always available)
- 🏦 No global standard for privacy-first identity

### The Solution
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Prove claims (age, nationality, identity) without exposing data
- **Offline-First:** Works 100% offline—no internet, no blockchain
- **On-Device:** All computation happens on your phone (Rust + Plonky2 ZK circuits)
- **Multi-Tier:** Government passport (Tier 1), National ID (Tier 2 coming), device biometric (Tier 3)

### Key Stats
- ✅ **~19ms** proof verification, **~14 MB** memory footprint (internal benchmarks — see [OFFLINE_IDENTITY.md](OFFLINE_IDENTITY.md))
- ✅ **100% offline** cross-device verification via QR
- ✅ **Hash-based cryptography, not elliptic-curve pairings** (FRI-based via Plonky2) — avoids the assumptions Shor's algorithm is known to break, a promising property for post-quantum resistance, though not formally certified
- ✅ Designed with data minimization in mind (no raw personal data retained) — not a formal compliance certification

> Note: numbers above are our own internal benchmarks on test hardware, not an independently verified comparison against Groth16 or a legal compliance audit. Treat as directional, not certified.

## How It Works (Simplified)

### Tier 1: Government Passport 🛂

```
1. 📷 Scan passport's photo page with camera
   ↓
2. 📱 Tap phone to passport (NFC chip)
   ↓
3. 🔐 Encrypted handshake using ICAO 9303 standard
   ↓
4. ✅ Verify government's digital signature
   ↓
5. ⚙️ Generate Plonky2 zero-knowledge proof (~80ms)
   ↓
6. 📤 Share proof (not personal data) with website
   ↓
✅ Website grants access (banking, age verification, etc.)
```

**What the proof proves:** "I am human, 18+, from [country], passport valid"
**What is hidden:** Name, exact DOB, passport number, passport photo

---

### Tier 3: Device Biometric 👆

```
1. 👆 Scan fingerprint/face on phone
   ↓
2. 🔑 Access device's encrypted identity key
   ↓
3. ⚙️ Generate Plonky2 proof (~100ms)
   ↓
4. 📤 Share proof (not biometric template)
   ↓
✅ Proves: "This is a real device, unique, genuinely mine"
   (Great for passwordless login, CAPTCHA replacement)
```

---

### Cross-Device QR Verification 📲

```
Device A (Prover)              Device B (Verifier)
├─ Generate proof              ├─ Open camera
├─ Encode as multi-phase QR    ├─ Scan QR stream
├─ Cycle: FWD → RWD → RND      ├─ Reconstruct proof
└─ Display (no internet)       ├─ Verify locally (5ms)
                               └─ ✅ or ❌ result
```

**No internet required. No central server. Just math.**

### Core Circuits (Simplified)

**Tier 1: Passport Proof**
```
Private (Prover only):          Public (Anyone can verify):
├─ Passport data (DG1)          ├─ Merkle root
├─ Govt signature               ├─ Nullifier (replay protection)
├─ DOB, nationality             └─ Valid timestamp
└─ Merkle tree path

Constraints:
✓ Merkle proof is valid
✓ Age >= 18 (range check)
✓ Nationality matches
✓ Government signature valid
```

**Tier 3: Device Proof**
```
Private:                         Public:
├─ Biometric template          ├─ Device binding (hw-backed)
├─ Device ID                   ├─ Nullifier (domain-scoped)
├─ Account creation date       ├─ Merkle root
└─ Challenge (server nonce)    └─ Proof of uniqueness

Constraints:
✓ Biometric exists (not zero)
✓ Device is real (attestation valid)
✓ Account age >= 30 days
✓ Proof hasn't been replayed
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust

**Format & Lint:**
```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

**Security:**
- Use `zeroize` crate for sensitive data
- Return `Result<T, E>` (not unwrap/panic)
- Validate all JNI inputs

**Documentation:**
```rust
/// Generates a zero-knowledge proof of age >= 18.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `passport_data` - Encrypted passport data from storage
/// * `domain` - Verifier domain (for replay protection)
///
/// # Returns
/// ZK proof (valid for 300 seconds)
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns `Err` if passport data is invalid or corrupted
pub fn generate_age_proof(passport_data: &[u8], domain: &str) -> Result<ZkProof> {
    // ...
}
```

### Kotlin

**Format & Style:**
```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `suspend` for JNI calls (not blocking)
- Handle nullability with `?.let { }` or `?:` operator
- Avoid `!!` operator (prefer safe alternatives)
- Use `viewLifecycleOwner` scope for UI updates

**Example:**
```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
    when (val result = securityGate.generateProof(passportData)) {
        is ProofResult.Success -> {
            withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
                displayProof(result.data)
            }
        }
        is ProofResult.Error -> showError(result.message)
    }
}
```

## Roadmap (Let's Build It Together)

**What we know:**
- ✅ v1.0 Beta — Tier 1 (passport) + Tier 3 (device) working
- 📅 v1.1 — OAuth integration, web SDK
- 📅 v2.0 — Tier 2 (National ID), iOS port

**What we DON'T know (yet):**
- Should we add AI-powered liveness detection? (Prevents deepfakes)
- Blockchain integration for issuer registry? (Decentralized keys)
- Marketplace for identity claims? (User privacy + monetization)
- Offline identity chain? (No internet ever needed)
- Post-quantum cryptography upgrade?
- Enterprise KYC/AML integration?
- Something completely different we haven't thought of?

**The answer is: it depends on what YOU think.**

---

## Let's Build the Future

ZKAuth started as a final year project. It's evolved into something bigger—a vision of **privacy-first, decentralized identity for everyone**.

But it's not complete. It's not even close.

**We need builders, thinkers, and dreamers.**

If you see a future where:
- ✅ You control your identity (not companies or governments)
- ✅ You prove claims without revealing data
- ✅ You use one identity everywhere (banking, voting, services)
- ✅ The system works offline, offline-first, resilient
- ✅ Privacy is the default, not an option

**...then there's a place for you here.**

### Questions?

1. **How do I get started?** Pick an issue from "Good First Issues" or share your idea in Discussions.
2. **Do I need cryptography knowledge?** No—start with docs/UI improvements, work your way up.
3. **Can I work on my own idea?** Absolutely. Open a Discussion first so we can align.
4. **What if my PR gets rejected?** All feedback is learning. We'll explain why and suggest alternatives.
5. **How long until my code is merged?** Depends on complexity—typically 1-3 weeks for review.
