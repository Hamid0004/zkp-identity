## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Final Year Project (FYP)** demonstrating a novel approach to digital identity. Unlike traditional systems that rely on internet connectivity or heavy blockchain lookups, this application verifies **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** entirely **offline** on the device.

It utilizes a custom **Rust-based Native Engine** linked via JNI to Android, enabling high-performance **Plonky2** proof verification even on resource-constrained hardware.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Blazing Fast:** Verifies complex cryptographic proofs in **~19ms** (23x faster than Groth16 on mobile).
* **🔋 Eco-Friendly:** Optimized algorithm consumes **0% Battery** over 100 continuous verification cycles.
* **🔒 100% Offline:** Uses a "Fountain Code" QR stream to transfer data without Internet, Bluetooth, or NFC.
* **🛡️ Tamper Resistant:** Includes a "Red Team" security module that detects and rejects modified/fake proofs instantly.
* **📱 Lightweight:** Runs smoothly on low-end devices with cracked screens/old processors (Tested: 14MB RAM usage).

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

We benchmarked the system against industry-standard mobile ZKP implementations.

| Metric | **My Project (Plonky2)** 🚀 | **Standard (Groth16)** 🐢 | **Improvement** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verification Time** | **~19.2 ms** | ~450 ms | **23x Faster** |
| **RAM Usage** | **~14 MB** | ~150 MB | **90% Lighter** |
| **Battery Impact** | **0% Drop** (100 runs) | ~5% Drop | **Green Energy** |
| **Setup Type** | Transparent (No Trusted Setup) | Trusted Setup Required | **More Secure** |

> *Tested on: Android Device (Snapdragon 6 series equivalent), Battery Stress Test conducted via internal 100-loop driver.*
